# Food Delivery Dataset
This is a repository for a project using the Food Delivery Dataset from Kaggle.

It follows the steps of opening the .csv using pandas, cleaning the data, and
presenting the data in some graphs using plotly.

The graphs are presented in a dashboard that uses streamlit for the web 
application.
